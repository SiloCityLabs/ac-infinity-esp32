This repository contains code and instructions to modify the AC Infinity products with an ESP32 microcontroller. The ESP32 is a powerful microcontroller that can be used to control the fan speed, monitor temperature and humidity, and connect to the internet. The modifications described in this repository will allow you to control your fan remotely, set up schedules, and monitor environmental conditions in your grow room or other indoor space.

 - Disassembly: Carefully open your AC Infinity vent to access the original PCB.
 - Compare PCB Layout: Match your ventâ€™s PCB layout with the images provided to ensure compatibility with one of the three supported versions.
 - Upload Firmware: Use the provided ESPHome configuration links to upload the correct firmware version to your ESP32 module or alternative firmware compatible with ESP32-c3 module.
 - Install the ESP32 Module:
 - Replace the existing PCB with the ESP32 module.
 - Connect the PWM fans and NTC thermistor to the corresponding terminals on the new PCB.
 - (If needed) Solder the power cable to the correct pads on the PCB.
 - Secure the Module: Reassemble the vent, ensuring that all connections are secure and the module is properly seated.
 - Test Functionality: Power on the vent and check that the display is working and the device connects to your Wi-Fi network.


### How to identify your Generation

3 buttons is Gen 1, 4 buttons is Gen 2.

### Gen 1 Rev 1

This revision of Gen 1 has an aligment issue. When installed you should only use two left screws to secure the PCB. The right screws will not align with the holes. Also includes individual fan control with two PWM outputs.
